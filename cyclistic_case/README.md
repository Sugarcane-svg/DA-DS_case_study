# Cyclistic Case Study

## Intro
	This analysis is for case study 1 from the Google Data Analytics Certificate (Cyclistic).  It’s originally based on the case study "'Sophisticated, Clear, and Polished’: Divvy and Data Visualization" written by Kevin Hartman (found here: https://artscience.blog/home/divvy-dataviz-case-study). We will be using the Divvy dataset for the case study. The purpose of this script is to consolidate downloaded Divvy data into a single data frame and then conduct a simple analysis to help answer the key question: “In what ways do members and casual riders use Divvy bikes differently?”

## Data Range
	I will use 11-month trip data in 2023 to ensure that the analysis is not outdated and that the findings are insightful and useful.
